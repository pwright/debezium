= Deployment of {prodname} Db2 connectors


You can use either of the following methods to deploy a {prodname} Db2 connector:

* xref:openshift-streams-db2-connector-deployment[Use {StreamsName} to automatically create an image that includes the connector plug-in].
+
This is the preferred method.
* xref:deploying-debezium-db2-connectors[Build a custom Kafka Connect container image from a Dockerfile].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to licensing requirements, the {prodname} Db2 connector archive does not include the Db2 JDBC driver that {prodname} requires to connect to a Db2 database.
To enable the connector to access the database, you must add the driver to your connector environment.
For information about how to obtain the driver, see xref:obtaining-the-db2-jdbc-driver[Obtaining the Db2 JDBC driver].
