= Deployment of {prodname} Oracle connectors


You can use either of the following methods to deploy a {prodname} Oracle connector:

* xref:openshift-streams-oracle-connector-deployment[Use {StreamsName} to automatically create an image that includes the connector plug-in].
+
This is the preferred method.
* xref:deploying-debezium-oracle-connectors[Build a custom Kafka Connect container image from a Dockerfile].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to licensing requirements, the {prodname} Oracle connector archive does not include the Oracle JDBC driver that the connector requires to connect to an Oracle database.
To enable the connector to access the database, you must add the driver to your connector environment.
For more information, see xref:obtaining-the-oracle-jdbc-driver[Obtaining the Oracle JDBC driver].
