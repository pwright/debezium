= Change data event enrichment

When transaction metadata is enabled, the data message `Envelope` is enriched with a new `transaction` field.
This field provides information about every event in the form of a composite of fields:

`id`:: String representation of unique transaction identifier.
`total_order`:: The absolute position of the event among all events generated by the transaction.
`data_collection_order`:: The per-data collection position of the event among all events that were emitted by the transaction.

The following example shows a typical transaction event message:

[source,json,indent=0,subs="attributes"]
